// REDUCER: In redux, the reducers are the pure functions that contain the logic and calculation that needed to be performed on the 
// state. These functions accept the initial state of the state being used and the action type. It updates the 
// state and responds with the new state. This updated state is sent back to the view components of the react to
// make the necessary changes. Basically, In short, we can say that Reducerâ€™s work is to return the updated state and to also describe how the state changes.
